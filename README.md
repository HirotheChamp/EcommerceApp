## Background
Organization can be the difference between success and coming up short. For this reason, I decided to create an application that could aid in the success of Developers in the field. BugsyTracker is a user-friendly app that is simple in design to help in field that is very focus-driven. A user can describe a bug whilst also assigning the issue to another member on their team with relative ease.

## Features
* Accepts input from developers on which bugs to address in their program
* Displays all current bugs that have been submitted
* Users may delete bugs from database after being addressed
* contact support section for questions about the application 

<hr></hr>

## Technologies Used

* React -- I decided to use React because of its popularity, making it a relatable library to use when developing an application
* MongoDB -- use to store data in the form of bugs and users created through the application
* Express -- enables connection to the frontend with minimal approach
* HTML, CSS, JSON -- used to create front end form creation script

## Project Status

Bugsy tracker currently has a working form to post bugs. Those bugs can also be deleted from the list. The front end support page has been created as well.

## Room for Improvement

* I could have tested code more frequently to ensure less mistakes in the future
* I should be more organized in how I arranged my folders and files
